    "lyrics": "Our coming-of-age has come and gone <br>Suddenly the summer, it's clear <br>I never had the courage of my convictions <br>As long as danger is near <br>And it's just around the corner, darling <br>'Cause it lives in me <br>No, I could never give you peace <br>But I'm a fire, and I'll keep your brittle heart warm <br>If your cascade ocean wave blues come <br>All these people think love's for show <br>But I would die for you in secret <br>The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me <br>Would it be enough if I could never give you peace? <br>Your integrity makes me seem small <br>You paint dreamscapes on the wall <br>I talk shit with my friends <br>It's like I'm wasting your honor <br>And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences <br>Sit with you in the trenches <br>Give you my wild, give you a child <br>Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other <br>Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother <br>Is it enough? <br>But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west <br>I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best <br>But the rain is always gonna come if you're standing with me <br>But I'm a fire, and I'll keep your brittle heart warm <br>If your cascade ocean wave blues come <br>All these people think love's for show <br>But I would die for you in secret <br>The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me <br>Would it be enough if I could never give you peace? <br>Would it be enough if I could never give you peace? <br>Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?"
